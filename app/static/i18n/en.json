        "PARTITION_DESCRIPTION_1": "Crate organizes data by itself into logical units, usually by time. If a good time frame for partitioning is set, this can enhance the performance greatly.",
        "PARTITION_DESCRIPTION_2": "Choose a batch size in which the data will be used later. If you have no idea, a month is a good suggestion.",
        "PARTITION_DESCRIPTION_3": "You have expected table size selected, in this case you need to specify the amount of partitions manually.",
        "REDUNDANCY_HEADING": "Redundancy",
        "REDUNDANCY_DESCRIPTION": "As said crate distributes replicas of the data among its network, one replica should be affordable storage wise, for redundancy and data integrity. Having no replicas is of course easy on storage but not advisable. By having more replicas the query speed can be enhanced significantly, because one query then can run on several copies of the same data simultaneously. Sadly that is very storage intense and does affect the write speed a little. So one replica is the normal way to go if you are very into query speed you can go with 3-4. Aside from that, having more replicas than nodes never makes sense. They have nowhere to go.",
